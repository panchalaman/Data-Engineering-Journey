# Data Engineering

SQL course and hands-on projects covering the full data engineering workflow — from writing your first query to building production data warehouses.

## SQL Course

The [SQL Lessons](SQL_COURSE/Lessons/) folder is a complete course that takes you from zero to data-engineer-ready SQL. 15 lessons split into two parts:

**Part 1 — Querying**: SELECT, WHERE, JOINs, GROUP BY, subqueries, CTEs, window functions, date/string functions  
**Part 2 — Building**: DDL, data modeling (star schema), DML, ETL patterns, query optimization, advanced SQL

Every lesson uses a real dataset of tech job postings and is designed to run in DuckDB. Follow the [Setup Guide](SQL_COURSE/Lessons/00_Setup.md) to install DuckDB and connect to the database.
